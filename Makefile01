### Variables, Environment Variables and Overrides ### 2/2: Precedence

# Let's split in three steps:

# First
# FOO is not defined on the environment variable
# $ > unset FOO
# If FOO is not set in the environment variable it will echo only
# FOO is

# Second
# FOO is defined on the environment variable
# $ > export FOO=outside
# if FOO is set in the environment variable, the inside variable overide it's value
# FOO is buz

# Third
# FOO is set on the environment variable and we pass FOO as a parameter when calling make from the command line
# $ make -e FOO=whatevert 	# Pass a value for FOO as Paremeter to the make 
# FOO is whatevert

# Conclusion:
## Command line beats makefile beats environment

TEST = bar
FOO  = buz

all: foo
all: ; @echo TEST is $$TEST
foo: ; @echo FOO is $$FOO
