# How to test this
# First simply call make -f Makefile07, we got
# BUILD_DEBUG is yes CFLAGS is -Wall CSANITIZE is
# as BUILD_DEBUG is not defined and CSANITIZE is not defined

# if later we call make -f Makefile07 -e CSANITIZE=yes, we got
# BUILD_DEBUG is yes CFLAGS is -Wall -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak CSANITIZE is whatever
# We will modify the value of CFLAGS as per the above idef statement
# BUILD_DEBUG will still be yes

# if we call
# make -f Makefile07 -e CSANITIZE=whatever -e BUILD_DEBUG=this 
# we will override the value of BUILD_DEBUG
# BUILD_DEBUG is this CFLAGS is -Wall -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak CSANITIZE is whatever
