### Variable Scopes, Target Specific Variables, Build Order### 2/3


# Here VAR is global scope, however we are defining all targets starting with b
# to be starts with b
# on the local and global scopes, and target specific variables
# So causing a conflict on definitions, what will have preference?

.PHONY: all foo bar baz car cucci
b%: VAR = starts with b

VAR = global scope

all: foo bar car cucci
all: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)

foo: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)

bar: VAR = local scope
bar: baz
bar: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)

baz: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)

# baz VAR is start with b
# bar VAR is local scope
# why, i guess because inline declaration has preferece over pattern %

c%: VAR = starts with c
car: VAR = likil skipi
car: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)

cucci: ; @echo In $@ VAR is $(VAR)
