### Delayed Assignment Variable ### := vs =


#The = defines a recursive variable, a variable value that is defined when it's
# used, but everytime you use the variable in this case FOO, it's is called again
# being computation expensive
BAR = before
FOO = $(BAR) the rain
BAR = after

# The := operator evaluates its right side immediately and uses the resulting 
# value to se the value of a variable
# They also have a single value determined the time the file is called
# so that being said, if we call a make clear for example it will evaluated unnecesarily
BAZ = before
FOZ := $(BAZ) the rain
BAZ = after 

all: ; @echo $(FOO)
	@echo $(FOZ)

# So above, FOO value is called in the all recipe, after BAR has been reasigned
# having the after value
# and FOZ has it's value inmediately assigned having the before value
